## How to file issues and get help

This project uses GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests. Please search the existing
issues before filing new issues to avoid duplicates.  For new issues, file your bug or
feature request as a new Issue.

Because this is intended for use by the Typescript team, you may also want to contact one of us directly.
Try the Typescript community discord or twitter.
